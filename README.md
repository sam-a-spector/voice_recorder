An attempt to add some features to recording software'

OBJECTIVE: Although there is excellent technology for recording sound, recording software doesn't seem to offer creators much in terms of interface and feedback while they are doing their work. A very basic example of a neglected feature is the relative lack of volume feedback--it is almost never provided, and when it is, it is only given in rough visual format. It ought to be simple to notice if a recording has slowly gotten quieter, or louder and this information ought to be quantifiable, and clearly presented to the creator during the take. This alone might save a lot of creative time and energy.

A number of features might be imagined to be useful: 

1. (Already noted) Alert the user in time of volume dropping off so that they do not wander away from a microphone mid performance.
2. Allow the user to organize takes while recording, and to redo parts of recording without starting from scratch or having to deal with an editor. A hotkey might on a computer or smartphone might be used to designate different takes of some aspect of a larger project, or to "save" one's place between sentences/parragraphs of a script. A hotkey might simply rewind the user back to the last long pause, or obvious pause between sentences so that he can record over only part of the take without starting from scratch on a longer take.
3. Recording software might provide some obvious visual feedback on the quality of sound automatically so that recordings can be redone immediately when they are ruined by interruption, ambient noise, or some sort of obvious mistake (things which a creator focused on the task of reading a script might not notice).
4. Recording sofware might provide useful feedback on the quality of vocals (or music) by flagging what most would regard as unpleasant qualities: in the case of music poor tuning, and in recordings common failings: mouth noises, lisps, voice fry, or simple instances of poor volume regulation. 
5. Determine the average space between a sentence break or a par. break, and provide a default amount of space between elements of a script by default, without any need for post production editing.
6. Allow spot editing--letting the user cut out the parts that did not work, and re-record parts of the script.... automatically adding some default amount of padding. 
7. Voice recognition, automatic layout of multiple takes (if one doesn't want to hit a hot key, or do takes that way.) An automatic-scrolling reader which advances at different speeds based on the speed that one is speaking.
